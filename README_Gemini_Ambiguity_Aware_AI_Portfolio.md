# Gemini Portfolio Notebook: Ambiguity & Conflict-Aware AI Systems

## Overview

This notebook demonstrates **advanced AI system design for handling ambiguity, conflicting signals, and human disagreement**. It consolidates three complementary frameworks, each illustrating **responsible, reliable, and interpretable AI decision-making** under real-world uncertainty.

The frameworks are:

1. **Ambiguity-Aware Decision Framework**  
2. **Legal Document Conflict Resolver**  
3. **Human Feedback Disagreement Framework**

Each framework follows a **consistent, stepwise structure**:
- Input Modeling
- LLM / AI Analysis
- Conflict or Disagreement Scoring
- Confidence Collapse Detection
- Abstention, Deferral, or Escalation Logic
- Human-in-the-Loop Reporting
- Visualization
- Summary & Engineering Takeaways

All code and Markdown are structured for **portfolio clarity, reproducibility, and visual impact**.

## 1. Ambiguity-Aware Decision Framework

**Purpose:** Evaluate how AI systems respond when inputs are **incomplete, conflicting, or ambiguous**.

Key capabilities demonstrated:
- Conflict detection between multiple incident signals
- Confidence collapse identification
- Explicit abstention, deferral, and human escalation
- Traceable decision-risk profiling
- Sophisticated, dashboard-ready visualizations

**Impact:** Shows mature engineering judgment and responsible AI design for high-stakes operational decision-making.

## 2. Legal Document Conflict Resolver

**Purpose:** Resolve **contradictory or ambiguous legal documents** while preserving traceability and legal safety.

Key capabilities demonstrated:
- Independent LLM analysis of each legal document
- Conflict scoring and authority-weighted confidence
- Detection of confidence collapse in legal interpretation
- Safe abstention, deferral, or escalation to human legal experts
- Professional visualizations for legal review dashboards

**Impact:** Illustrates AI-assisted legal reasoning while maintaining **auditability and human oversight**.

## 3. Human Feedback Disagreement Framework

**Purpose:** Handle **conflicting human feedback** for product, service, or feature evaluation.

Key capabilities demonstrated:
- Structured LLM analysis of multiple human feedback signals
- Quantification of disagreement, polarization, and credibility-weighted sentiment
- Confidence collapse detection for risky automated decisions
- Explicit abstention, deferral, or escalation to human review
- Sophisticated, portfolio-ready visualizations highlighting disagreements

**Impact:** Demonstrates AI systems that **respect subjectivity, mitigate risk, and communicate clearly** with human decision-makers.

## Design Philosophy

Across all three frameworks, the notebook emphasizes:
- **Reliability:** Safe system responses under ambiguity
- **Transparency:** Traceable reasoning and structured reporting
- **Human-in-the-Loop:** Escalation and abstention as designed outcomes
- **Visualization:** Clear, aesthetic, portfolio-quality visualizations
- **Portfolio Focus:** Demonstrates engineering judgment, responsible AI design, and real-world applicability

## Intended Audience

- Hiring managers evaluating AI system design, reliability engineering, or responsible AI portfolios  
- Engineers, product managers, and legal or operational teams interested in **interpretable AI workflows under uncertainty**
- Technical reviewers seeking evidence of **structured, safe, and auditable AI decision-making**
