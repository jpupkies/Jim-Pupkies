        "- **Step 1:** Defined explicit system states (`INIT`, `ANALYZE`, `REQUEST_INFO`, `ESCALATE`, `RESOLVE`, `FAIL_SAFE`) and a context object to maintain traceable incident data.\n",
        "- **Step 2:** Normalized raw incident input, enforcing validation and routing invalid entries to a fail-safe state.\n",
        "- **Step 3:** Queried the LLM to propose severity and action, while keeping all outputs advisory.\n",
        "- **Step 4:** Applied guardrails and validation rules to enforce safety, confidence thresholds, and mandatory escalation for critical incidents.\n",
        "- **Step 5:** Generated a structured, timestamped report capturing all inputs, LLM recommendations, decisions, and final states.\n",
