        "\n",
        "This notebook demonstrates a **reliability-first framework for LLM evaluation**. Key outcomes include:\n",
        "\n",
        "- **Structured evaluation pipeline**: Prompts, model responses, scoring signals, and diagnostics are fully machine-readable and reproducible.\n",
        "- **Failure-mode awareness**: Correct answers, incorrect answers, hallucinations, and abstentions are explicitly categorized.\n",
        "- **Confidence calibration**: Confidence scores are used to detect overconfidence and underconfidence, providing actionable signals for downstream systems.\n",
        "- **Ambiguity handling**: High-risk or underspecified prompts are identified, and correct abstention is treated as a valid outcome.\n",
        "- **Visual and tabular diagnostics**: Summary metrics, failure-mode counts, and confidence plots highlight areas for improvement in both prompts and model behavior.\n",
        "\n",
        "This approach treats LLM outputs as **contracts rather than free-form text**, reflecting real-world AI engineering practices.\n",

        "- **Rule-grounded reliability**: Explicit handling of uncertainty, hallucinations, and abstention.\n",
        "- **Data engineering**: Structured datasets, merging responses, and annotation pipelines.\n",
        "- **Analytical visualization**: Multi-dimensional insights via plots and tables.\n",
        "- **Production-ready mindset**: Designing outputs that are deterministic, explainable, and interpretable.\n",

        "This framework can be extended to:\n",
        "\n",
        "1. **Automated prompt refinement**: Detect patterns in failure modes and suggest prompt improvements.\n",
        "2. **Multi-model comparison**: Evaluate multiple LLMs using the same dataset and scoring framework.\n",
        "3. **Expanded dataset**: Incorporate additional high-ambiguity, hallucination-prone, or reasoning-heavy prompts.\n",
        "4. **HTML or PDF reporting**: Generate shareable reports summarizing evaluation metrics, failure modes, and confidence analyses.\n",
        "5. **Continuous evaluation**: Integrate into CI/CD pipelines for production LLM systems to monitor reliability over time.\n",

        "\n",
        "3. **HTML Report Generation**  \n",
        "   - Export the notebook results as a self-contained HTML file.\n",
        "   - Shareable with colleagues, hiring managers, or stakeholders without requiring Python.\n",

        "2. **Dashboard Tables**\n",
        "   - Summarize prompts, responses, confidence, and evaluation labels in a single interactive table.\n",

        "\n",
        "4. **Portfolio Presentation**\n",
        "   - Use visually distinct palettes and professional formatting.\n",
